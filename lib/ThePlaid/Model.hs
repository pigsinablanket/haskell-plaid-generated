data AccountBalance = AccountBalance
  { accountBalanceAvailable :: !(Maybe Double) -- ^ "available" - The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  For &#x60;credit&#x60;-type accounts, the &#x60;available&#x60; balance typically equals the &#x60;limit&#x60; less the &#x60;current&#x60; balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  For &#x60;depository&#x60;-type accounts, the &#x60;available&#x60; balance typically equals the &#x60;current&#x60; balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For &#x60;depository&#x60;-type accounts, the &#x60;available&#x60; balance does not include the overdraft limit.  For &#x60;investment&#x60;-type accounts, the &#x60;available&#x60; balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  Note that not all institutions calculate the &#x60;available&#x60;  balance. In the event that &#x60;available&#x60; balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an &#x60;available&#x60; balance value of &#x60;null&#x60;.  Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60;.
  , accountBalanceCurrent :: !(Double) -- ^ /Required/ "current" - The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  For &#x60;credit&#x60;-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  For &#x60;loan&#x60;-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (&#x60;ins_116944&#x60;). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account&#39;s balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.  For &#x60;investment&#x60;-type accounts, the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60;, and current balance information is typically not updated intra-day. If you require realtime balance information, use the &#x60;available&#x60; balance as provided by &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60;.
  , accountBalanceLimit :: !(Maybe Double) -- ^ "limit" - For &#x60;credit&#x60;-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  For &#x60;depository&#x60;-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  In North America, this field is typically only available for &#x60;credit&#x60;-type accounts.
  , accountBalanceIsoCurrencyCode :: !(Maybe Text) -- ^ "iso_currency_code" - The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if &#x60;unofficial_currency_code&#x60; is non-null.
  , accountBalanceUnofficialCurrencyCode :: !(Maybe Text) -- ^ "unofficial_currency_code" - The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if &#x60;iso_currency_code&#x60; is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported &#x60;unofficial_currency_code&#x60;s.

Institution status is accessible in the Dashboard and via the API using the `/institutions/get_by_id` endpoint with the `include_status` option set to true. Note that institution status is not available in the Sandbox environment.

-- By default, Link will only display account types that are compatible with all products supplied in the `products` parameter of `/link/token/create`. You can further limit the accounts shown in Link by using `account_filters` to specify the account subtypes to be shown in Link. Only the specified subtypes will be shown. This filtering applies to both the Account Select view (if enabled) and the Institution Select view. Institutions that do not support the selected subtypes will be omitted from Link. To indicate that all subtypes should be shown, use the value `\"all\"`. If the `account_filters` filter is used, any account type for which a filter is not specified will be entirely omitted from Link. For a full list of valid types and subtypes, see the [Account schema](/docs/api/accounts#accounts-schema).  For institutions using OAuth, the filter will not affect the list of institutions or accounts shown by the bank in the OAuth window.

  , linkTokenCreateRequestCountryCodes :: !([CountryCode]) -- ^ /Required/ "country_codes" - Specify an array of Plaid-supported country codes using the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code standard. Institutions from all listed countries will be shown.  Supported country codes are: &#x60;US&#x60;, &#x60;CA&#x60;, &#x60;ES&#x60;, &#x60;FR&#x60;, &#x60;GB&#x60;, &#x60;IE&#x60;, &#x60;NL&#x60;. Example value: &#x60;[&#39;US&#39;, &#39;CA&#39;]&#x60;.  If Link is launched with multiple country codes, only products that you are enabled for in all countries will be used by Link. Note that while all countries are enabled by default in Sandbox and Development, in Production only US and Canada are enabled by default. To gain access to European institutions in the Production environment, [file a product access Support ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/product-troubleshooting/request-product-access) via the Plaid dashboard. If you initialize with a European country code, your users will see the European consent panel during the Link flow.  If using a Link customization, make sure the country codes in the customization match those specified in &#x60;country_codes&#x60;. If both &#x60;country_codes&#x60; and a Link customization are used, the value in &#x60;country_codes&#x60; may override the value in the customization.  If using the Auth features Instant Match, Same-day Micro-deposits, or Automated Micro-deposits, &#x60;country_codes&#x60; must be set to &#x60;[&#39;US&#39;]&#x60;.

Only institutions that support *all* requested products will be shown in Link; to maximize the number of institutions listed, it is recommended to initialize Link with the minimal product set required for your use case. Additional products can be added after Link initialization by calling the relevant endpoints. For details and exceptions, see [Choosing when to initialize products](/docs/link/best-practices/#choosing-when-to-initialize-products).  In Production, you will be billed for each product that you specify when initializing Link. Note that a product cannot be removed from an Item once the Item has been initialized with that product. To stop billing on an Item for subscription-based products, such as Liabilities, Investments, and Transactions, remove the Item via &#x60;/item/remove&#x60;.

  , linkTokenCreateRequestRedirectUri :: !(Maybe Text) -- ^ "redirect_uri" - A URI indicating the destination where a user should be forwarded after completing the Link flow; used to support OAuth authentication flows when launching Link in the browser or via a webview. The &#x60;redirect_uri&#x60; should not contain any query parameters. If &#x60;android_package_name&#x60; is specified, this field should be left blank. Any redirect URI specified here must also be added under the \&quot;Allowed redirect URIs\&quot; configuration on the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api). In non-Sandbox (Production and Development) environments, the &#x60;redirect_uri&#x60; must begin with https.

  , studentLoanExpectedPayoffDate :: !(Maybe Text) -- ^ "expected_payoff_date" - The date when the student loan is expected to be paid off. Availability for this field is limited. Dates are returned in an ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  , studentLoanGuarantor :: !(Maybe Text) -- ^ "guarantor" - The guarantor of the student loan.
  , studentLoanInterestRatePercentage :: !(Double) -- ^ /Required/ "interest_rate_percentage" - The interest rate on the loan as a percentage.
  , studentLoanIsOverdue :: !(Maybe Bool) -- ^ "is_overdue" - &#x60;true&#x60; if a payment is currently overdue. Availability for this field is limited.
  , studentLoanLastPaymentAmount :: !(Maybe Double) -- ^ "last_payment_amount" - The amount of the last payment.

  , studentLoanLoanStatus :: !(Maybe StudentLoanStatus) -- ^ "loan_status"
  , studentLoanMinimumPaymentAmount :: !(Maybe Double) -- ^ "minimum_payment_amount" - The minimum payment due for the next billing cycle. There are some exceptions: Some institutions require a minimum payment across all loans associated with an account number. Our API presents that same minimum payment amount on each loan. The institutions that do this are: Great Lakes ( &#x60;ins_116861&#x60;), Firstmark (&#x60;ins_116295&#x60;), Commonbond Firstmark Services (&#x60;ins_116950&#x60;), Nelnet (&#x60;ins_116528&#x60;), EdFinancial Services (&#x60;ins_116304&#x60;), Granite State (&#x60;ins_116308&#x60;), and Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (&#x60;ins_116945&#x60;). Firstmark (&#x60;ins_116295&#x60; ) will display as $0 if there is an autopay program in effect.
  , studentLoanNextPaymentDueDate :: !(Maybe Text) -- ^ "next_payment_due_date" - The due date for the next payment. The due date is &#x60;null&#x60; if a payment is not expected. A payment is not expected if &#x60;loan_status.type&#x60; is &#x60;deferment&#x60;, &#x60;in_school&#x60;, &#x60;consolidated&#x60;, &#x60;paid in full&#x60;, or &#x60;transferred&#x60;.

  , studentLoanOutstandingInterestAmount :: !(Maybe Double) -- ^ "outstanding_interest_amount" - The total dollar amount of the accrued interest balance. For Sallie Mae ( &#x60;ins_116944&#x60;), this amount is included in the current balance of the loan, so this field will return as &#x60;null&#x60;.
  , studentLoanPaymentReferenceNumber :: !(Maybe Text) -- ^ "payment_reference_number" - The relevant account number that should be used to reference this loan for payments. In the majority of cases, &#x60;payment_reference_number&#x60; will match a&#x60;ccount_number,&#x60; but in some institutions, such as Great Lakes (&#x60;ins_116861&#x60;), it will be different.

If no seed is specified, the randomly generated data will be different each time.  Note that transactions data is generated relative to the Item's creation date. Different Items created on different dates with the same seed for transactions data will have different dates for the transactions. The number of days between each transaction and the Item creation will remain constant. For example, an Item created on December 15 might show a transaction on December 14. An Item created on December 20, using the same seed, would show that same transaction occurring on December 19.
  -> [OverrideAccounts] -- ^ 'userCustomPasswordOverrideAccounts': An array of account overrides to configure the accounts for the Item. By default, if no override is specified, transactions and account data will be randomly generated based on the account type and subtype, and other products will have fixed or empty data.

A value of `good` will result in successful Item creation and `bad` will result in a `RECAPTCHA_BAD` error to simulate a failed reCAPTCHA. Both values require the reCAPTCHA to be manually solved within Plaid Link.
  -> Text -- ^ 'userCustomPasswordForceError': An error code to force on Item creation. Possible values are:  `\"INSTITUTION_NOT_RESPONDING\"` `\"INSTITUTION_NO_LONGER_SUPPORTED\"` `\"INVALID_CREDENTIALS\"` `\"INVALID_MFA\"` `\"ITEM_LOCKED\"` `\"ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED\"` `\"ITEM_NOT_SUPPORTED\"` `\"INVALID_LINK_TOKEN\"` `\"MFA_NOT_SUPPORTED\"` `\"NO_ACCOUNTS\"` `\"PLAID_ERROR\"` `\"PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED\"` `\"USER_SETUP_REQUIRED\"`
